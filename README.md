# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository!

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual coding challenge that runs throughout December. Each day, a new puzzle is released with a festive twist, offering a fun way to practice problem-solving and sharpen coding skills.
